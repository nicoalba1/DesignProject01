# DesignProject01
DesignProblem01 for AE 353: Aerospace Controls

Goal:
To Stabalize a spinning sattelite about 1-axis by applying thrust to 2 actuators that will change the angular velocities of the satellite.

#To run:
1) Open Files in MATLAB
2) In the command window run:
    DesignProblem01('Controller','diagnostics',true)
